<p>Hello! I'm Wes Carr. I'm an egoless design generalist, specializing in art direction, design-dev collaboration, and conversion optimization.</p>


<h2>My Values (as a designer)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tie to the business.</strong><br />
	I see not just the production tasks, but the entire product ecosystem, from the technology to the business side.</li>
	<li><strong>Design is a team sport.</strong><br />
	I happily join forces with developers and encourage non-designers to give their insight. </li>
	<li><strong>Don't make (the user) think.</strong><br />
	This guiding light prioritizes the user and their entire experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Data-informed.</strong><br />
	Use appropriate research method for the project. Data can help tell the story behind design choices.</li>
	<li><strong>Code.</strong><br />
	Code competency doesn't box in, it shows me the edges of constraint and inspires me to keep up with updates. </li>
	<li><strong>Explain why.</strong><br />
	The hidden side of design is necessary for success. Documentation, proposals, presentations to stakeholders. </li>
</ul>
